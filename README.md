## Quantitative Imaging Toolkit (QITK) 

The aim of this project is to develop a image analysis software for quantitative magnetic susceptibility MRI with convinient graphical interfaces written in python, pyQT, cython and C.

The image viewer has been finished. 3D phase unwrapping using path-based uwnrapping and using Laplacian-based phase unwrapping has been completed. Next steps are to implement a robust method for segmentation, background phase removal and quantitative susceptibility mapping using cython and C programming.
